Short:    GamePack - Tiny Games for Amiga/AROS
Author:   Henning Kiel (henning@tilt.prima.ruhr.de)

Version:  pre_1.0 AROS-Source 970823
Type:     misc/emu/AROS/game

This is a package of some tiny games I started to program some time ago.
Now, I'm `porting` it to OS2.0 + AROS.
This is the pre-release of some of them. While AROS is being developed,
only some of the OS' features are implemented, and so things may change
when AROS is (a) complete (operating system).

DESCRIPTIONS:
-------------
Mine -	is a clone of the well known game Mine-Sweeper. As long as
	window-gadgets are not supported for the linux version of AROS
	the escape-key is used to quit the program (only in menus).
	The main feature provided with this version is a solving-helper,
	which does all the 'dirty' work, i.e. the clicking-around at
	obvious places.
Jump -	is a solitair game on which you have to jump with one stone across
	another (next to it, which has to be in the same row or column) which
	will then be removed. You win when you managed to remove all stones
	exept one, which should be in the middle.
JumpEd-	is the Editor for the starting-combination of the above game.
	Quit with escape-key.
Quad -	is another solitair game. First, you choose the starting combination
	on the left half and the finish combination on the right half, then
	the game is started with the start button. It can be aborted with the
	stop-button and quit with escape. You try to get both sides match
	while pushing unpressed gadgets on the left side.
	a short map:  1  2  3
	              4  5  6
	              7  8  9

	If you push 5, 2,4,5,6,8 are inverted
	If you push 2, 1,2,3 are inverted, 4->1,4,7;6->3,6,9;8->7,8,9
	If you push 1, 1,2,4,5 are inverted, 3->2,3,5,6;7->4,5,7,8;9->5,6,8,9

Wumpus-	Is the well-known game in which you have to hunt for Wumpus in his
	caves.
