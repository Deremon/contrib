This ugly, sparsely-commented program is the source for text2pdf version
1.1.  It should be ANSI-conforming and compile on most platforms.  You'll
need to change LF_EXTRA to 1 for machines which write 2 characters for \n.
These include PCs, of course.

You may distribute the source or compiled versions free of charge.  You may
not alter the source in any way other than those mentioned above without
the permission of the author, Phil Smith <phil@bagobytes.co.uk>.
