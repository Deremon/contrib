OWB 0.9.3 for AROS

INTRODUCTION

Origyn Web Browser is a web browser designed for CE devices such as mobile
phones, portable media players, Set Top Boxes and TV decoders, and any other
consumer electronic product (GPS, home-gateways, Web-radios, PVR, DVD
recorders, wireless devices etc.) 

AROS port of Origyn Web Browser is a Zune-based application created by
Stanislaw Szymczyk as one of the requirements of "Port an Open Source Browser
To AROS" bounty. It's using OWB encapsulated in a Zune class as a rendering
engine. 

The AROS port extends default OWB in numerous ways, most important are:

* Support for file downloads
* Ability to open multiple tabs
* Graphical preferences manager
* Localization

REQUIREMENTS

OWB for AROS requires AROS build from 19.02.2009 or newer to run. If your AROS
installation is older and you don't want to reinstall the whole system, you
can try updating only arosc.library and muimaster.library, but there's no
guarantee that it will work correctly.

OWB needs a running TCP/IP stack to work. It's needed even if you only want to
browse some files offline. See AROS documentation for more information about
configuring the stack.

USAGE

When running OWB from a Shell you can specify an URL to open in argument.

During the first run OWB is generating a font cache. This process may take
some time, but it's done only once. Generated cache is stored in fonts/cache
directory.

To manage tabs use context menu in the tabs section.

To download a file use link context menu and choose "Download Linked File".

To access files located on disk use paths in the following form:

file:///System:S/Startup-Sequence

The following keyboard shortcuts are implemented:

F1 - go back
F2 - go forward
F3 - zoom page in
F4 - zoom page out
ctrl+c or amiga+c - copy
ctrl+x or amiga+x - cut
ctrl+v or amiga+v - paste

TROUBLESHOOTING

If OWB appears to be hanged and you've just executed it for the first time,
it's most likely still generating the font cache, so be patient.

If OWB is crashing, make sure you are using an appropriate AROS build. See
REQUIREMENTS section for more details. Another cause of crashes may be too
small stack size. Increase your stack size to at least 1MB and try again 
before reporting a bug.

If OWB says it can't open bsdsocket.library, then you most likely don't
have a TCP/IP stack running. See REQUIREMENTS section for more details.
