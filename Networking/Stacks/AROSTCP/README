Below are brief instructions on how to configure and run AROSTCP under
native AROS. It is assumed that AROS has already been installed onto
hard disk.


Configuration
=============

There are a number of files in AROSTCP's 'db' subdirectory that need to
be changed using a text editor (eg. 'Editor', found in AROS's Tools
directory):

db/hosts: At the end of the file, there is an entry for a computer/device
called "gateway". Change the IP address at the start of this line to
that of your actual gateway, eg. your router.

db/netdb-myhost: In the 'HOST' line, change the IP address to the real
IP address of your computer. You also need to change the address in the
NAMESERVER line to that of your real DNS server.

db/interfaces: At the end of the file, there are configuration entries
for different network cards. Enable the entry for your network card by
removing the '#' from the start of one of the lines that begin with
"#eth0".

If you're using a home network, and you don't know what values to use in
the 'hosts' and 'netdb-myhost' files, try running AROSTCP without
changing them. The default values might work in a lot of cases.


Usage
=====

To start AROSTCP, open a shell and type the following two commands:

 CD SYS:Extras/Networking/Stacks/AROSTCP/C
 Execute startnet

To stop AROSTCP, run the Status command in a shell to get its process
number, and then enter

 Break N

where N is the process number.
