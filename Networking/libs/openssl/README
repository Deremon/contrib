This is a port of openssl-0.9.8j to AROS operating system. It's based on
earlier openssl-0.9.8g port done by Rob Norris. Some bugs were fixed and
support for building on x86-64 AROS was added.

To build openssl-0.9.8j with the AROS build system you need to download and
patch openssl-0.9.8j sources first and place them in this directory. Then
make contrib-networking-openssl should do the job.
