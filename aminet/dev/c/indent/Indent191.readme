Version: 1.9.1
Type: dev/c

This is a mostly unchanged port of the GNU Indent 1.9.1, a C/C++ source
code formatter.

I have ported this piece of software for the Amiga, and I have
successfully compiled it under SAS/C.

Source code is included, to recompile just say 'smake'. Makefile and
some changes to the source code is 'homemade'... this is my first
port 'from scratch' of a GNU software! :))

I have also converted the TeXInfo documentation to AmigaGuide format. See
in the Docs drawer.

To install, simply copy the Indent program somewhere in your path.

Please report me any bug!

Much thanks to the GNU guys for their great software!

Have fun,
Sandro Tolaini <tolaini@freenet.hut.fi>
