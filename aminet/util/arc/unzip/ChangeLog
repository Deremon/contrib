	* Makefile (gcc_amiga): I added this as target for an amiga
	running AmigaDOS using gcc as compiler.  It is intended to
	call make with option M=unix because the gcc stuff is
	derived from BSD.  But watch it not BSD, sometimes you
	have to use SYSV.

	* unzip.h: if you compile with gcc no SAS/C or AZTEC specific suff
	is included or defined.
	You can only compile with gcc2.7.0 or better.
