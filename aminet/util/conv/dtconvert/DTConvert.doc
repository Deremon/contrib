DTConvert/DTConvert                                       DTConvert/DTConvert

    NAME
       DTConvert -- DataTypes-based conversion tool

    FORMAT
       DTConvert [FROM|NAME|SRCNAME <file>]
                 [DESTDATATYPE|DATATYPE|DTN <datatype>]
                 [TO|DESTNAME <file>] [GUI] [PUBSCREEN <public screen>]

    TEMPLATE
       FROM=NAME=SRCNAME,DESTDATATYPE=DATATYPE=DTN,TO=DESTNAME,GUI/S,
       PUBSCREEN/K

    PURPOSE
       Convert data from one format into another format using datatypes
       classes.

    DESCRIPTION
       DTConvert converts data from one format into another format,
       e.g. picture -> picture,
            animation -> anmation,
            movie -> movie,
            sound -> sound,
            text -> text (n/a)

      You simply have to set the souce file name (SRCNAME), the
      datatype to convert to (DATATYPE) and the destination file name (TO).

      The datatype option accepts the format names as they are written in
      DEVS:DataTypes, e.g. if you ant to save a mpeg video stream,
      you've to set DATATYPE="MPEG Video".
      If you want to use the base class (to save the incoming data to a 
      matching IFF format, simply specify the base class name, e.g.
      "picture" for picture.datatype, "sound" for sound.datatype, 
      "animation" for animation.datatype and so on.

      If you miss one of the options or if you set the GUI switch, a small
      GUI will appear where you can set the options.
      If ou're done with setting all neccesary things in the GUI, the
      "Convert"-button gets enabled.
      Selection of the "Convert"-button starts the encoding job...

    BUGS
      - picture.datatype V43 interface not implemented.
        This causes that any encoder only runs in V42 mode any may
        only encode 8 bit data.

      - path names are limitted to 1024 chars, larger filenames may cause
        mailfunctions. But: Who uses so long path names ?

      - datatypes.library versions V45.3 and V45.4 have a bug in
        NewDTObjectA which causes that a descriptor is unlocked too often,
        which results in an Alert( 3500000 ). >= V45.5 fixes this.

    NOTES
      - picture.datatype V43 pixmap interface not supported.

      - text conversion not supported yet.

      - DTConvert prints a message if a subclass does not
        implement a local encoder. This was only done to get rid
        of mails like "your DTConvert has a bug: IFF ILBM -> PNG does
        not work...". These mails should go to the authors of the
        datatype classes, not to me. Sorry, but...

    TODO
      - picture.datatype V43 compatibility

      - text conversion (GID_TEXT -> GID_TEXT), e.g. IFF FTXT <-> Ascii

      - document conversion (GID_DOCUMENT -> GID_DOCUMENT), after
        Stefan Ruppert and I finsished the document.datatype concepts.

    HISTORY
       V1.1:
         - First release to dta@amigawolrd.com mailinglist.

       V1.2:
         - Added support for animation.datatype subclasses

       V1.3:
         - Minor fixes.

       V1.4
         - Added support for sound.datatype V40 subclasses, partial support
           for suggested sound.datatype V41 interface.

         - Added some usefull comments.

         - WriteAnimClass/WriteSoundClass now sets
           SetIoErr( ERROR_REQUIRED_ARGUMENT_MISSING ); if something goes
           wrong (this should abort the encoder; only ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
           is accepted here).

         - Fixed some holes in the error handling.

         - GUI added.

         - Added WB support

         - Added ENV variable support; a local or global (ENV) variable
           "DTConvert" takes the same arguments as the shell template.
           Variable settings can be overridden by any argument.

         - Project split in seperate sources (e.g. main, GUI, converters)

       V1.5
         - Added the feature that the datatypes selection requester shows
           only entries which match the source group IDs
           (if a source has been already selected).

         - Added kluge which alows the conversion between GID_MOVIE
           and GID_ANIMATION datatypes (both are based on
           animation.datatype, here we have the same interface :-)

         - Fixed the bug that ConvertAnimation function did not deal
           with truecolor bitmaps (e.g. CyberGFX bitmaps for example,
           truecolor bitmaps are indicated by ADTA_NumColors == 0.
           Fixed.

       V1.6
         - Fixed the bug that ObtainDataTypeA was called for each
           INTUITICK if the datatype selection requester was open.
           Fixed.

       V1.7
         - Fixed the bug that a descriptor was unlocked too often
           in some cases. See BUGS section above about a matching bug
           in datatypes.library V45.3 and V45.4 (V45.5 fixes this).
           Fixed (both "datatypes.library" and "DTConvert").

         - The datatypes requester now accepts ESC as "Cancel" and
           RETURN as OK.

         - The tool can now be aborted by SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C.

         - Fixed the bug that somtimes an error return code
           was overwritting by the Message() function.

         - Fixed the bug that the IFF comandline switch did not work
           (the GUI prompted everytimes in this case). But IFF and
           GUI switches does currently not co-operate :-(

         - Fixed a bug in the WB startup code which caused that a project
           without an icon wasn't processed. The code now uses
           GetDiskObjectNew instead of GetDiskObject to fix this.
           Fixed.

         - If launched from WB, "DTConvert" now opens a console window
           manually. Previously, the default WB output channel was used
           (which was NIL:).
           Same for project childs.

         - Added output which prints a message if a subclass does not
           implement a local encoder. This was only done to get rid
           of mails like "your DTConvert has a bug: IFF ILBM -> PNG does
           not work...". These mails should go to the authors of the
           datatype classes, not to me. Sorry, but...

         - If more than one project icon is given at WB startup, "DTConvert"
           now launches the matching number of projects instead
           of processing the given icons in sequence.

         - Fixed problems with WB project startup and the current directory.

         - The icon now contains the (possible) options and sets the
           stack size up to 16384 bytes.

       V1.8
         - Shame on me. 
           In the last minutes of the V1.7 release build I
           decided to make "DTConvert" resident (using cres.o), which
           bombs out any __saved marked code has used by the animation
           converter section.
           Fixed.

         - Completly removed the IFF switch because it was really
           unneccesary. If you want to save in the base class format,
           simply specify the name of the base class, e.g.
           "document" for documents,
           "text" for texts,
           "picture" for pictures,
           "sound" for sample data,
           "animation" for animation (and movies, due lack of a
               movie.datatype subclass)
           and so on...
           And the same from the GUI.

         - The "no encoder"-message is now avoided if a base class did the
           encoder job.

         - Added stack checking code. Now "DTConvert" forces the user
           to use at least 16k stack to et rid of stack related problems...

         - Minor code cleanup.
