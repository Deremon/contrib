Minor:

- Fix the prototypes of ExecuteTask() and AboutTask() for AROS.
  Implement running them as tasks/processes, which should be
  quite easy (they are written with that in mind from the
  beginning).

- Figure out why the background-pattern is drawn so slowly.
  Probably something with BGUI.

- Implement a memory-meter in the screen-title. Just write it
  as a hook to be called by BGUI when IDCMP_IntuiTicks occurs.

Major:

- Well, the filemanager part of Workbench. With icons and
  fancy stuff like that. :-)

  Probably needs new BGUI classes to work nicely (IconClass,
  IcongroupClass), but a quickie could be done with normal gadgets.
  Or you could skip using BGUI for that part of Workbench.
