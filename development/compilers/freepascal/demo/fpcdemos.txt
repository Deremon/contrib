FPC demo package
================
This packages contains the following subdirs:

- text   texmode demos (should run everywhere)
- graph  demos that use the graph unit (runs nearly everywhere)
         includes gameunit (text&graph), outputs to another subdir level
- modex  demos that make extensive use of modeX (runs with go32v2 only)
- win32  demos that are win32 specific
- linux  demos that are linux specific

To build the programs simply type 'make' in the base dir.

If you want to add further sampels, edit Makefile.fpc
and rebuild the real Makefile by entering 'fpcmake'.
This is a special fpc generic utility to simplify
platform independent makfile generation to the user.
