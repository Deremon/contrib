The 'print' command doesn't work, you always get an exception right away.
However, using sys.stdout.write() works fine. This might be connected 
with the disapearing-exception-problem, described below.


#0002 chodorowski 10/10/2001 CRITICAL FIXED

Exceptions aren't printed properly, only the beginning headers are 
displayed. The actual message (eg. type of exception, like "ImportError") 
isn't displayed, ie:

>>> raise NameError, 'Test'
TraceBack (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
>>>


#0003 chodorowski 10/10/2001 CRITICAL FIXED

Importing modules written in Python doesn't work (you get an exception 
right away), even after having hacked getpath.c and friends to be 
AROS-compatible. Hmmm...

The following regression tests fail: test_builtin, test_cpickle,
test_import, test_time, test_unicode, test_sax, test_minidom,
test_difflib, test_format, test_string, test_strop.
See STATUS for more information.

#0005 chodorowski 25/11/2001 MEDIUM OPEN

The regression tests test_longexp and test_bufio take a lot longer
to complete under AROS than under, say, Linux. On my machine,
test_longexp takes 2.20 s under Linux and 17 MINUTES under AROS,
and test_bufio takes 1 s and 2 MINUTES respectively! That's a *HUGE*
difference in time. Also, if the stack is set to low they crash AROS.
Maybe some recursion related thing?

Running test_gzip crashes AROS. It seems to happen when data is 
written in append mode to a file.
