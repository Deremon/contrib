BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

You need to have gcc, binutils, collect-aros, abc-shell, make, coreutils, sed,
findutils, grep and yacc installed to build Perl.

Build process will hang if you are using amberram.handler. The problem is
that DupFHFromfd() function is not working with AmberRAM's handles opened in
write mode. You have to switch to old ram.handler.

For the same reason you have to build perl in Ram Disk. It's the only AROS
filesystem besides Unix emul.handler allowing DupFHFromfd() to work for
handles opened in write mode.

Steps needed to build and install Perl:

1. Download Perl 5.7.2 sources
2. Unpack them and apply perl-5.7.2-aros-$(CPU).diff patch
3. Copy patched sources to RAM:
4. Run abc-shell (SYS:Development/bin/sh) and cd to Perl source directory
5. find . -name "*.SH" -exec sh \{\} \;
6. make
7. make install

Installation directory (/usr) is hardcoded in config.sh file.

Tested on:

* AROS linux-x86_64
* AROS pc-i386
