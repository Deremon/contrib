paintcan cursor doesn't work
    - i don't know why
    - perhaps it's a limitation of libSDL
    - this seems wierd.

no on-screen menus yet
 
line draw optimizations are counteracting order for vector line drawing
    - re-implement all of the graphics primitives

a brush color picked up in one screen may be a different color in the other
screen, but will draw correctly.
    - a single 'screen palette' needs to be imposed.

Some resolutions don't draw properly on OS X
    - is this an OS X only issue?

8 bit display does not function

- the paint callback is getting called with 0,0 when it no longer has focus.
    - it should get called with -1, -1, to tell it that the mouse
      is external to the screen.
    - this is causing the full-screen redraws when a window is
      dragged i think.
