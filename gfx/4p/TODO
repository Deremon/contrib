For 1.0 release, the following should be done:

Startup:
    - create two screens, main and swap

UI Widgets
    _ Menus
    _ text selection scroll box
    _ Graphic Buttons
    _ Palette Box

UI Dialogs
    _ Palette Requestor
    _ File requestor dialog box

Mechanism
    _ zoom window needs to actually zoom
    _ re-implement rubberband blit for zoom
    _ re-implement dirty rectangles between zoom, and JSUI (none now)
    _ IFF file save
    _ implement a mask buffer to which the tools get drawn (will
	    the rubberbanding buffer work for this?)  so that filled
	    tools can just make their normal unfilled versions,
	    fill to the new buffer, then blit to the active page.
	    (redo becomes trivial)
    _ split screen for zoom window a la depuxe laint
    _ Amiga Font loader (font requestor, etc.)
    _ Color cycling

Tool Improvements 
    _ Integrate pat's flood fill algorithm (into jsui?)
    _ proper filled circle
    _ on-screen text editing for text input.
