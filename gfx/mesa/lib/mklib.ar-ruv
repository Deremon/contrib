# AROSMesa 3.0
#
# - Based on the official mesa 3 code with major patches to the amigamesa driver code to get it working.
# - GLUT not yet started (ive left the _old_ mesaaux, mesatk and demos in for this reason)
# - Doesnt yet work - the _db functions seem to be writing the data incorrectly, and color picking also seems broken somewhat - giving most things a blue tinge (those that are currently working)
