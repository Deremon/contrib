What is this?
 Directory contains a set off diffs and this file of 
instructions on how to obtain and build the gnu which command 
for AROS.
 At this point I have only used a fully-built crosscompiler 
(see: AROS/contrib/gnu/gcc/README) to build this command.

Basic instructions:

fetch ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/which/which-2.16.tar.gz
tar -zxvf which-2.16.tar.gz
cd which-2.16
patch -p1 < ../which-2.16-aros.diff
./configure --host=i386-aros
gmake

Using:

 The only file you actually need from the directory you built 
the which command in is the which executeable itself. 

Todo:

 I need to go through and redo some of the brutal workarounds 
with proper ifndefs and the like.
