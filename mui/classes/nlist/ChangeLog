    * initial cvs commit
    * mui classes moved to their own directories
    * ppc makefiles added
    * stack check disabled (wasn't compatible with morphos)
    * nlist, nlistview, nlistviews, nfloattext ported to morphos
      (varius hook, vararg, etc patches)

2001-02-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

    * Re-added makefiles for m68k ;)
    * Added method MUIM_NList_SelectChange
    * Automatic conversion of NList_mcc.h in
      NList_mcc/makefile.ppc
    * Bumped version to 19.98

2001-02-27  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

	* Moved Floattext to own directory and added MorphOS changes

2001-06-14  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

	* Tracked back the floattext wrap bug and fixed it (*_mcc4.c).
      All important lines which were changed between 0.89 and 0.89+
      by Gilles and caused the wrap bug are marked with $$$WRAP for
      future reference.

2001-06-16  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

    * Reworked entry manangement to use pointers insted of full
      structures. This makes NList much faster (factor 3-4) in
      some cases, but slows down a bit when inserting entries at
      the bottom. Not much...

2001-06-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

    * Added experimental value MUIV_NList_Redraw_ColsVisible for
      width calc of only the visible lines.

2001-06-20  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

    * Enforcer hit on dispose removed.
    * Now omits column width calculation code if numcols == 1.
      With only one column, NList is now faster than List. Yeahh!
    * Shrink of entries array is now omitted. Same as List does i
      think.

2001-06-23  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

    * Added MorphOS DoSuperMethod() to NFloattext.c
    * Added common/mcc_debug.h for better debugging ;)
    * Changed common/mcc_debug.c
    * Changed common/mcc_common.h to support GNU/SAS...
    * Changed some internal handling and added tree class support
      in NList ;-)
    * Changed version strings to NList#?.mcc ...
    * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.101
    * Fixed wrong MorphOS hooks...

2001-06-27  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

    * Changed memory handling routines in NList_func3.c and NList_mcc.c
    * Changed common/mccheader.h to support SAS/C.
    * Changed NList_mcc/NList_mcc.c OM_NEW attributes handling, minor speedup.
    * Fixed every library.c of each MCC, first function of library based
      executable MUST do nothing and return 0.  Executing old MCC causes
      unexpected crashes.
    * Fixed and cleanuped OM_GET method of NList.mcc getting
      MUIA_NList_DragColOnly attribute could cause unexpected results!
    * Fixed library id string. It's not equal to version string!
    * Added missed names of authors in id string.
    * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.102

2001-07-01  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

    * Added new methods MUIM_NList_Construct and MUIM_NList_Destruct.  Now
      every internal method is calling these methods instead of playing
      with hooks directly.  In NList subclass you can override them to your
      own version.
    * Fixed IdStrings again...  MUI dislikes MCC which haven't $VER:  at
      the beggining of IdString and AboutMUI wasn't showing such MCC (but
      MCC is working correctly!) in the list...
    * Fixed global and local SMakefiles (dependency tree was broken (by me)
      and "sometimes" project wasn't rebuilded...) In global smakefile
      'all' was missing and it cauesed some troubles with objects/
      directories (this's not my fault).
    * Added useful scripts to make and clean objects/ directories.
    * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 20.103

2001-24-12 Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

    * Merged aphaso and sensei changes and commited all files to the
      cvs (only tried the SAS compile)
    * small smakefile changes

2002-03-05 Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

    * Added a define MUIV_NList_UseImage_All for MUIM_NList_UseImage
      which stands now for -1
