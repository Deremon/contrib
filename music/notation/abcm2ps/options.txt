		Command line options
		====================

The list of the command line options may be known running:
	'abcm2ps -h'

When an option starts with '+', this one is disabled.

List of the options
-------------------

  -
	Read the abc file from stdin.

  -a<float>
	See: format - maxshrink <float>

  -B<int>, +B
	See: format - barsperstaff <int>

  -b<int>
	See: format - measurefirst <int>

  -c, +c
	See: format - continueall <bool>

  -D<dir>
	Search the format files in the directory <dir>.

  -d<unit>
	See: format - staffsep <unit>

  -E, +E
	Produce EPS output instead of simple PS.
	In this mode, each tune goes to a different file which
	name is '<name>nnn.eps' (see '-O' for <name> - 	'nnn' is
	the tune sequence number.
	EPS files are normally embedded into Postscript documents,
	but they may be a way to generate graphical images. For
	example, using GhostScript:
		abcm2ps voices -E -e7
		gs -sDEVICE=pngmono -r80 -g590x174 \
			-dBATCH -dNOPAUSE \
			-sOutputFile=quitolis.png Out001.eps
	(the values for -g are the values of the bounding box in
	 the .eps, multiplied by (80 / 72), where 80 is the value
	 for -r, and 72 is the default resolution)

  -e<list>
	Select the tunes inside an ABC file.
	<list> is a comma separated list of items (tune numbers).
	Each selector applies to the previous associated ABC file.
	An item may be a single index value (as indicated in the 'X:'
	field), or a range of such values. A range is indicated as
	<first_index>-<last_index>. The last index may be omitted
	meaning 'end of file'.
	Example:
		abcm2ps voices -e 5,2-4 newfeatures -e5-
	Note: Filtering may raise problems, mainly on global definitions.

  -F<file>, +F
	Read the format file <file>.fmt. In the form '+F', the default
	format file ('default.fmt') is not read.

  -f
	See: format - flatbeams <bool>

  -G, +G
	See: format - graceslurs <bool>

  -H
	Display the current format values.

  -h
	Quick help, equivalent to "abcm2ps" without any arguments.
	This also shows the default settings for some parameters.

  -I<unit>
	See: format - indent <unit>

  -j<int>[b], +j
	See: format - measurenb <int>

  -k<int>[b], +k
	See: format - measurenb <int>

  -L<int>
	See: format - encoding <int>

  -l, +l
	See: format - landscape <bool>

  -M, +M
	See: format - musiconly <bool>

  -m<unit>
	See: format - leftmargin <unit>

  -N<int>, +N
	Number the pages.
	<int> indicates the mode:
		0  no page numbers
		1  at top left
		2  at top right
		3  at top left on even pages, top right on odd pages
		4  at top right on even pages, top left on odd pages
	For compatibility with previous versions, '+N' is the same as
	'-N0', and '-N' is the same as '-N2'.
	If a header is defined ('%%header'), this option is ignored.

  -n, +n
	See: format - writehistory <bool>

  -O<name>, +O
	Define the output file name.
	By default, the output file name is 'Out.ps' for PS, and
	'Outnnn.eps' for EPSF (see option '-E' for the Postscript
	mode).
	With this option, it will be <name> or <name>nnn.eps.
	If <name> is '=', the output file has the name of the ABC
	source file with the extension '.ps' or '.eps'.
	If <name> is '-', the result is written on stdout.

  -s<float>
	See: format - scale <float>

  -u
	Select the abc2ps implicit decorations.

  -V
	Show the version number.

  -w<unit>
	See: format - staffwidth <unit>

  -W<voice><keypitch>, +W
	Display a tin whistle tablature for the voice number <voice>.
	This number ('1' to '9' only) is the number internally
	incremented as new voices are encountered; it is not the voice
	name. Up to 4 tablatures may be defined.
	Ex: '-W1c -W2Bb,'.

  -x, +x
	See: format - withxrefs <bool>

  -0, +0
	See: format - splittune <bool>

  -1, +1
	See: format - oneperpage <bool>
