* Stack check can be activated again

see NList_func.h for STACK_CHECK and STACK_ALERT macros
    NList_mcc.c for Calc_Stack

* quick&dirty hacks can be changed with proper solutions

MyCallHookPktA in NList_func3.c
DoSuperNew() call in NList_mcc.c
MUI_MakeObject() in nlistviews.mcp

* move.c (replacement functions for memory copying)

change them with memmove, etc

* porting of other parts

nlist_demo (in demo/ dir) and other test apps and rarely used
classes (in misc/ dir) can be ported too.

* cleaning up warnings

there are many pointer to int without cast warnings.
they are mostly harmless...

* anything else? :)
