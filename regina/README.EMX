                        Regina 2.2
                       for OS/2 EMX

This file contains 32 bit executables of the Regina Rexx interpreter for
OS/2 EMX, and some sample programs, most of which are designed to test
new features of this interpreter.

Regina is distributed under the GNU Library General Public Licence.
See COPYING-LIB for details.

This port of Regina is for use in OS/2. It uses the EMX 0.9d runtime.

The files in this archive are:

README       - this file
README.2x    - readme files for 2.x releases of Regina
COPYING-LIB  - GNU Library General Public Licence
file_id.diz  - Description file for BBS use
rexx.exe     - 32bit Regina Rexx interpreter static executable
regina.exe   - 32bit Regina Rexx interpreter executable (uses regina.dll)
rxstack.exe  - 32bit Regina Stack server
rxqueue.exe  - 32bit Regina Stack client
regina.dll   - Regina dynamic library
rexx.a       - Regina static library
rexx.lib     - Regina static library
regina.a     - Regina import library for regina.dll
regina.lib   - Regina import library for regina.dll

test1.dll    - Sample external function packages; used by dynfunc.rexx
test2.dll      demo Rexx program
demo\*.rexx  - Sample Rexx programs

Installation is simply a matter of copying the rexx.exe
files into a directory specified in your PATH environment variable.

You also need the EMX 09d runtime distribution; emxrt.zip.  This file
provides emx.dll, the only file from emxrt.zip that Regina requires.

See the README file in emxrt.zip for details on setting up the EMX
runtime.

Please report any bugs with this release of Regina to me, NOT to Anders.
Most likely the bugs are of my origin, so I will attempt to fix them.
As with previous bugs fixed by me, I will pass these fixes on to Anders.

Cheers, Mark.
