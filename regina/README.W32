                        Regina 2.2
                      for Win9x/NT/2k

This distribution contains 32 bit executables of the Regina Rexx interpreter 
for Win9x/NT/2k, and some sample programs, most of which are designed to test
new features of this interpreter.

Regina is distributed under the GNU Library General Public Licence.
See COPYING-LIB for details.

This port of Regina to Win9x/NT/2k differs from the port of Regina on the
Windows NT Resource Kit in two ways:

1)  This port is sanctioned by the author of Regina, Anders Christensen.
2)  This port does not provide any OLE or Win32 support nor does it
    provide builtin access to the Registry.  It does however, provide the
    standard Rexx API.  This enables C programs written under OS/2 and
    Unix that use the standard API, to be easily ported to Win9x/NT/2k.
    It also means that C programs written using Quercus Rexx and Object
    Rexx under Win9x/NT/2k to be recompiled using Regina, and C programs
    written for Regina to be recompiled using Quercus Rexx or Object
    Rexx.
    The Win32 functions that were built into Regina are available as
    an external function package from http://www.interlog.com/~ptjm

The remainder of this document is relevant only if you are not installing
Regina via the InstallShield (R) installation.

Installation is simply a matter of copying the regina.exe and regina.dll
files into a directory specified in your PATH environment variable.

If you wish to be able to run Rexx programs automatically, ie without
specifying the regina.exe or the file extension, then run the following
Windows commands from a command prompt: (you only need to do this once)
Note: The following commands will only work under NT/2k; they are not
supported under Windows 95/98.

C:\> ftype Regina=c:\bin\regina.exe "%1" %*
C:\> assoc .rexx=Regina
C:\> set PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.rexx

The above commands assume that regina.exe is in c:\bin and that you
only want to execute Rexx programs that have an extension of .rexx.
Add another ASSOC command to associate files with other extensions.

You will probably want to set the PATHEXT variable in the Environment 
section of the System Control Panel applet.

Using this build of Regina with other Win32 Compilers
=====================================================
Nearly every C compiler on the Win32 platforms generates object code that
is incompatible with one another.  So using this build of Regina with a
C compiler other than MS Visual C/C++ requires that you link with the
import library appropriate to your compiler.  The import libraries supplied
in this package are:

Compiler        Library Name
--------------------------------
Cygwin          libregina_cygwin.a
Borland C++     regina_borland.lib
MingW32         libregina_ming.a
