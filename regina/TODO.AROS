* Remove the wrapper functions in aros_funcs: either by using the C calling
  convention for the functions in the library (e.g. like arosc.library) or
  by changing rexxsaa.c so that the registers are used overthere.
  PS: Probably don't want to remove the wrapper functions so regina can be
      backported to Classic Amiga OS.
* Implement the external queue function (compile without NO_EXTERNAL_QUEUES).
* Add ARexx specific functions
  To implement:
  - ADDLIB
  - BITCOMP
  - EXISTS
  - EXPORT
  - FREESPACE
  - GETCLIP
  - GETSPACE
  - IMPORT
  - PRAGMA
  - RANDU
  - REMLIB
  - SETCLIP
  - SHOW
  - STORAGE
  Implemented:
  - CLOSE
  - EOF
  - OPEN
  - READCH
  - READLN
  - SEEK
  - WRITECH
  - WRITECH
  - B2C
  - C2B
  - BITCHG
  - BITCLR
  - BITSET
  - BITTST
  - COMPRESS
  - HASH
  - TRIM
  - UPPER
* Fix the ARexx vs. ANSI REXX incompatibilies.
  These are: ^ is XOR in ARexx but is not in ANSI REXX.
  Multiple line strings in ARexx are not there in ASNI REXX and are said
  that they need to be avoided because the error handling is difficult
  to do with multiple line strings. Without them the interpreter knows
  when a close string character is forgotten at the end of a line.
* and probably a lot more ...
