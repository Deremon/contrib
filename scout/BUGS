Known issues with AROS port:

BoopsiClasses
    The classes should be shown in a tree which shows parent/child
    relations. But on AROS they are shown flat, though some have
    an arrow.

Devices
    On AROS the handlers appear in the list. Double clicking on a handler
    causes a segfault; doing OpenDevice on an handler seems to be bad.

Libraries
    Clicking on a function in the function list segfaults. CopyMem is
    done with address -1. Maybe the start address is calculated wrongly.

Locks
    List is empty.

Tasks
    Segfault when enabling "in %". It needs to be checked how this
    task time calculation can be done on AROS.

Catalogs
    Catalog names aren't shown.
