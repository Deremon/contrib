SUPPORTED ENCODINGS/FORMATS:

 - 8-bit u-law/A-law
 - 8, 16, 24 & 32-bit linear (PCM)
 - IEEE Float (32 & 64-bit)
 - G.721 (4-bit, untested)
 - G.723 (3 & 5-bit, untested)

Fragmented files are not supported at the moment.

INSTALLATION:

1. copy the file SUN_AU to DEVS:DataTypes/.
2. copy sun_au.datatype to SYS:Classes/DataTypes/.

Alternatively, if you have the OS4 SDK installed, you can just type "make install" and both files will be installed to their correct places.

BUGS:

None known. If you find any, contact me by e-mail (fredrik at a500 dot org).
The same goes for (if you have any) .au/.snd encodings/formats that are not yet supported in this datatype.

COMPILING:

To compile just type "make". To compile without G.72X support use "make G72X=0".

In order to be able to recreate the descriptor (from AU.dt) file you will need to have the MakeDT.rexx arexx script installed in REXX: (can be downloaded from http://aminet.net). The rest will be handled by the Makefile.

CHANGES:

50.1
 - enabled G.72X support (untested)

0.2 (5-May-2005)
 - fixed memory trashing in wave_class.c (was the cause of some instability)

0.1 (26-Apr-2005)
 - first released version of the datatype
